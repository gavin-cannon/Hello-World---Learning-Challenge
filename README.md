# Overview

I am learning new technologies in different applications in order to become an effective software engineer. I am doing this by taking two weeks and learning about one skill/technology/language starting with a plan and then executing that plan. Spending 10 hours per week on learning about this tech.

This is a simple Hello World in Python to kick off my coming weeks of learning.

To establish the pattern of uploading a new public repository to my GitHub that shows what I have learned with documentation.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used VS Code version 1.85.1 as my IDE.

I used Python.
